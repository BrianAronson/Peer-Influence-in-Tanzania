This repository was written 2018-2019. It is relevant to three inter-related projects about peer influence of HIV testing, peer influence of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, and the norms underlying the spread of such behaviors. All three projects use social network and demographic data from individuals in Tanzania and all three rely on Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOMs) with RSiena. Results indicate that IPV behavior is subject to peer influence, the influence of a social network intervention on HIV testing is entirely mediated by peer-influence effects, and that group-level injunctive norms (i.e. whether individuals think that their social group believes that they should get tested for HIV) is most predictive of whether individual's adopt their peer's HIV testing behavior.
